JavaScript Dependency Manager for IntuitiveCMS
=========

This repository is used to manage common JavaScript library dependencies for moduels.

If a module needs a specific JS library this repo is used to host them in a manageable way.

If the library or a specific version of the library you need isn't here you should open a new issue or make a pull request with the new library.
